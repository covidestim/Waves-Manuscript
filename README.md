    - data-products/ ## All the data generated from the model, such as final runs for the CAR model
    - data-sources/ ## All the source data used by the model, such as Meta30m population estimates and covidestim model observations coded to FIPS.
  - Scripts/ ## Scripts numbered to run the whole analysis, some of the data is not the complete dataset due to a limit on storing files in git.
